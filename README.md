# ImageX---Advanced-Image-Processing-Toolkit
ImageX is a powerful and lightweight image processing application, designed to offer a wide array of tools for various image manipulation tasks. This project allows users to perform operations such as image loading, grayscale conversion, edge detection, and more, all within a simple and intuitive interface.

Features:
Load Image: Import images in various formats.
Grayscale Conversion: Convert colored images to grayscale.
Binary Thresholding: Apply binary transformation to create black-and-white images.
Embossing: Add an embossed effect to the image.
Gaussian Blur: Smooth images with Gaussian blur.
RGB Conversions: Convert images between different color spaces.
Sharpening: Enhance image sharpness to bring out details.
Histogram Synchronization: Equalize and adjust the image histogram.
Canny Edge Detection: Detect edges using the Canny method.
Sobel Edge Detection: Apply Sobel operator for edge detection.
Region Growing: Segment images using region growing techniques.
Morphological Operations: Perform operations such as dilation, erosion, and others.
How to Run:
Clone the repository: git clone <repo-link>
Open the project in your preferred IDE.
Install required dependencies.
Run the application.
This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in exploring the basics of image processing and computer vision.
